HOW TO USE: Use these code examples as a guideline for formatting your HTML email. You may want to create your own template based on these snippets or just pick and choose the ones that fix your specific rendering issue(s). There are two main areas in the template: 1. The header (head) area of the document. You will find global styles, where indicated, to move inline. 2. The body section contains more specific fixes and guidance to use where needed in your design.

DO NOT COPY OVER COMMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CODE to your message or risk spam box banishment :).

It is important to note that sometimes the styles in the header area should not be or don't need to be brought inline. Those instances will be marked accordingly in the comments.

<!-- Using the xHTML doctype is a good practice when sending HTML email. While not the only doctype you can use, it seems to have the least inconsistencies. For more information on which one may work best for you, check out the resources below.

UPDATED: Now using xHTML strict based on the fact that gmail and hotmail uses it.  Find out more about that, and another great boilerplate, here: http://www.emailology.org/#1

      <!-- Gmail/Hotmail image display fix: Gmail and Hotmail unwantedly adds in an extra space below images when using non IE browsers.  This can be especially painful when you putting images on top of each other or putting back together an image you spliced for formatting reasons.  Either way, you can add the 'image_fix' class to remove that space below the image.  Make sure to set alignment (don't use float) on your images if you are placing them inline with text.-->
